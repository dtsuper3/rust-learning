In twilight's gentle, fading light,
Whispers dance, the stars ignite.
A moonbeam's kiss on tranquil streams,
Unveils the night's enchanting dreams.

Softly sways the willow tree,
Echoing the night's decree.
Crickets sing their lullaby,
Underneath the midnight sky.

Through the fields of silver dew,
Winds of time are passing through.
Memories in shadows cast,
Glimpse of futures, echoes past.

Silent nights, a cosmic show,
Stars above in mystic glow.
Whispered secrets, dreams unfold,
In the night, tales retold.

Embrace the calm, the serene night,
In its depths, find pure delight.
A world asleep, yet so alive,
In nightâ€™s embrace, we thrive.
